# Spark and HDFS Labs

## Lab-5.1: Accessing HDFS files from Spark

This is a quick lab we will access data on HDFS from Spark

[Lab instructions](5-1_accesssing-hdfs-files.md)

## Lab-5.2: Generating data

* In this lab, you will use a **data generator script** to create some sample data.
* We can configure partition size for the generated data
* We will generate various partition sizes (small to large)

[Lab instructions](5-2_generate-data.md)

## Lab-5.3: Partition size vs processing times

* In this lab, we will run Spark jobs on data of various partition sizes and compare the results

[Lab instructions](5-3_partition-size-and-processing.md)

## Lab-5.4: Merging small files into large files

* In this lab, we will explore how to detect small files and merge them into large files
* Lab instructions (TODO)
