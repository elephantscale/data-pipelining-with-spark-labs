# Spark and Hive

## Objective

Hive is the datawarehousing component of Hadoop.  Hive let's us define tables and permissions for data.  Spark can work well with Hive.

In this module you will learn about using Spark and Hive

## What you will learn

- Understand Spark and Hive
- Interacting with Hive from Spark
- Accessing Hive tables from Spark
- Querying Hive tables using Spark SQL

## Knowledge Check

**What are the advantages of Spark-SQL over HiveQL?**

**Are there any benefits to querying a hive table from Spark as opposed to querying using HiveQL?**

## Essential Reading

### Hive

* [Hive Essentials](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/apache-hive-essentials/9781788995092/) gives a quick overview of Hive and its features
* [A quick Hive tutorial](https://www.guru99.com/introduction-hive.html)

### Spark and Hive

* [Ch 5. Spark SQL and DataFrames: Interacting with External Data Sources](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-spark-2nd/9781492050032/ch05.html)  from book [Learning Spark - 2nd Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-spark-2nd/9781492050032/)

## Extra Reading

### Hive

* [Hive project page](https://hive.apache.org/) has upto date information on Hive's new features

## Labs
