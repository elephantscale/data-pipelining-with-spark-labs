# Spark and Kafka

## Objective

Kafka is a very popular streaming platform.  Spark works really well with Kafka.  In this chapter, we will explore integrating Spark and Kafka.

## What you will learn

- Learn about Kafka
- Learn Spark streaming
- Get Spark streaming working with Kafka

## Knowledge Check

**What is the difference between 'event based streaming' and 'micro batch streaming'?**

**What are the features of 'structured streaming'?**

**What are the sources and sinks in streaming?**

## Essential Reading
